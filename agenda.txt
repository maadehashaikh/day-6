6_ setting up ejs for ejs pages 
simply jo frontend hmy dikhy ga woh h ejs 
actually ejs hota html kay jaisa he h but us mai aik chez ki advantage h kay woh apko dynamically bh kam kar kay dy dyta h if we write in html <h1> 2+2 </h1> => this will print 2+2 not it will calculate it but if we tell ejs to calculate it it will calculate it so this is the major difference 
  its first step is install ejs from npm => npm i ejs 
  setup ejs as a view engine

7_ setting up public static files
